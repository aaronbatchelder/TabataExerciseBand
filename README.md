# TabataExerciseBand

Synopsis
This iOS app is a basic interface for using an mbientlab MetaWear board (more info at https://mbientlab.com) as an interval training band. It's purpose is to act as a customizable interval trainer and also use standard intervals such as tabata, etc..  

Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out how your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

Motivation

I had this idea prior to taking a Swift course, and ended up using it as a final project. I exercise fairly frequently and because I'm often short on time I do tabata workouts (20 seconds of work, 10 seconds rest, 8 rounds). That said headphone wires get in the way, and loud beeping timers at the gym are annoying for everyone which is why I wanted to create this band. mbientLab has an amazing little microcontroller with everything you'd want along with a silicon band so you can wear it on your wrist.

Installation

This has "out-of-the-box" functionality and should connect directly to your metawear board and allow you to set custom intervals as long as the software updates for the board haven't deprecated the code.'

API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.


Contributors

I'd be happy to have contributors on the project. There are some pretty glaring errors with the timer display and some basis timer functionality in general that I haven't had time to fix. I can be reached at @aaronbatcheldr if you're interested.'
